# /onboard - Project Setup Guide

$ARGUMENTS

## What This Command Does

Guide the user through setting up the ai-toolkit in their project, including configuration and customization.

## Setup Steps

### Step 0: Intent Capture Interview

Before setting up tooling, understand the project's undocumented context. Ask the developer these questions (adapt based on what the codebase scan reveals):

1. **What's the one thing a new contributor always gets wrong?** — This reveals the biggest documentation gap
2. **Are there files or directories that should NOT be modified?** — Identifies protected areas (legacy, generated, vendor)
3. **What's the deployment model?** — Monolith, microservices, serverless, edge — shapes which agents and skills are most relevant
4. **Are there non-obvious constraints?** — Compliance requirements, performance budgets, browser support matrix
5. **What's the team's review culture?** — Strict PR reviews, trunk-based, pair programming — configures `/review` behavior

Use answers to:
- Customize the generated `CLAUDE.md` with project-specific warnings and conventions
- Select the right `--profile` (minimal/standard/strict) automatically
- Pre-configure relevant language rules

### Step 1: Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Claude Code CLI installed
- [ ] ai-toolkit repository cloned
- [ ] Current directory is the target project

### Step 2: Install Toolkit
```bash
# Run the installer from the toolkit directory
/path/to/ai-toolkit/install.sh
```

This creates symlinks in `.claude/`:
- `agents/` -> toolkit agents
- `skills/` -> toolkit skills (slash commands + knowledge skills)
- `hooks.json` -> quality gates
- `constitution.md` -> safety rules

### Step 3: Configure CLAUDE.md
Create a project-specific `CLAUDE.md` from the template:
```bash
cp /path/to/ai-toolkit/CLAUDE.md.template ./CLAUDE.md
```

Customize with:
- Project description and tech stack
- Coding standards specific to this project
- Common development commands
- Architecture notes

### Step 4: Configure Settings
Edit `.claude/settings.local.json` for project-specific settings:
- MCP server connections
- Permission overrides
- Environment variables

### Step 5: Verify Installation
```bash
/path/to/ai-toolkit/validate.sh
```

### Step 6: Quick Start Guide

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/explore` | Understand the codebase |
| `/plan` | Plan a new feature |
| `/test` | Run tests |
| `/review` | Code review |
| `/commit` | Create a structured commit |



## Usage Examples

```
/onboard              # Full guided setup
/onboard verify       # Just verify existing installation
/onboard update       # Update toolkit symlinks
```

## Rules

- **MUST** run the intent-capture interview before creating any files — skip only if the user provides answers up front
- **NEVER** overwrite an existing `CLAUDE.md` without confirming
- **CRITICAL**: prefer project-local installation (`--local`) unless the user asks for global
- **MANDATORY**: verify installation at the end with the toolkit's validate script

## Gotchas

- On Windows without WSL, symlink creation requires either Developer Mode or admin privileges. The installer **silently skips** agents and skills that cannot be linked — verify with `ai-toolkit doctor` after install on Windows hosts.
- If `.claude/` already exists as a real directory (not a symlink), `ai-toolkit install` will not replace it. Old files linger. Check `ls -la .claude/` for mixed symlink + real-file state before onboarding.
- `settings.local.json` is per-user and gitignored, but `settings.json` is shared. Users who edit the wrong file lose their overrides on `git pull`.
- When the target project is a **git submodule**, the toolkit's notion of "project root" (outermost `.git`) differs from the developer's — symlinks may land in the parent repo instead of the submodule. Confirm `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before installing.

## When NOT to Use

- To update an already-onboarded project — use `/onboard update`
- To scaffold a new app from scratch — use `/app-builder`
- For plugin development inside ai-toolkit — use `/plugin-creator`
- When the project already has its own CLAUDE.md conventions — discuss migration before overwriting
