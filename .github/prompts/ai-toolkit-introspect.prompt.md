# Agent Self-Debugging

$ARGUMENTS

Structured self-analysis for when the agent is stuck, looping, or producing degraded output.


## Step 1: Capture Failure State

Before diagnosing, gather the facts. Answer each question concisely:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Last goal/task** | What was the agent trying to accomplish? |
| **Actions taken** | List the last 3-5 actions in order |
| **Errors or unexpected results** | What went wrong? What was expected vs actual? |
| **Attempt count** | How many times has this been tried? |
| **Time spent** | Rough estimate of effort so far |


## Step 2: Classify the Failure Pattern

Identify which pattern matches the current situation:

| Pattern | Symptoms | Common Cause |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Loop** | Same action repeated 3+ times | Missing exit condition, wrong approach |
| **Drift** | Actions diverge from original goal | Lost context, scope creep |
| **Assumption Error** | Working with wrong mental model | Didn't read code, assumed behavior |
| **Tool Misuse** | Wrong tool for the job | Grep when should Read, Bash when should Edit |
| **Context Overflow** | Forgetting earlier findings | Too much context, need compaction |
| **Wrong Abstraction** | Over-engineering simple task | Premature abstraction, YAGNI violation |
| **Missing Information** | Can't proceed without data | Need to ask user, read more code |

Pick the **single best match**. If multiple apply, pick the root cause pattern (the one that, if fixed, would resolve the others).


## Step 3: Diagnose Root Cause

Answer these three questions:

1. **What assumption was wrong?** — Identify the specific belief that led to failure.
2. **What information was missing?** — What would have prevented the failure if known earlier?
3. **What would a fresh start look like?** — If starting over with current knowledge, what would the first action be?


## Step 4: Select Recovery Action

Choose the **smallest recovery action** and apply the smallest possible fix — do not restart from scratch unless absolutely necessary:

| Pattern | Recovery Action |
|---------|----------------|
| **Loop** | Stop. Change approach entirely — different tool, different strategy, different angle. |
| **Drift** | Re-read the original user request verbatim. Reset scope to exactly what was asked. |
| **Assumption Error** | Read the actual code, file, or docs. Do not guess. Verify the mental model. |
| **Tool Misuse** | Switch to the correct tool. Read instead of Grep for full context. Edit instead of Bash for file changes. |
| **Context Overflow** | Summarize all findings so far in 5 bullet points. Compact and continue. |
| **Wrong Abstraction** | Delete the abstraction. Do the simplest, most direct thing that works. |
| **Missing Information** | Ask the user exactly ONE specific question. Do not guess. |


## Step 5: Produce the Introspection Report

Output exactly this format:

```markdown
## Introspection Report

**Pattern:** [Loop|Drift|Assumption Error|Tool Misuse|Context Overflow|Wrong Abstraction|Missing Information]
**Root Cause:** [1-2 sentence diagnosis]
**Recovery Action:** [Specific next step]
**Confidence:** [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]

### What happened
[Brief timeline of actions taken — 3-5 bullet points max]

### What went wrong
[Specific diagnosis — what assumption failed, what was missed]

### What to do next
[ONE concrete action — not a plan, a single next step]
```


## Rules

- **MUST** name a specific failure pattern (Loop / Drift / Assumption Error / Tool Misuse / Context Overflow / Wrong Abstraction / Missing Information) — vague self-diagnosis is useless
- **MUST** ground the diagnosis in concrete evidence (action traces, error messages, tool outputs) — not in feelings or hunches
- **NEVER** retry the exact same action. If it failed once, it will fail again. Change something.
- **NEVER** continue a loop "hoping it will work this time". Hope is not a strategy.
- **CRITICAL**: after 3 failed attempts, escalate to the user with a concrete report of what was tried, what failed, and what you need — do not keep flailing
- **MANDATORY**: the recovery action is ONE concrete next step, not a multi-phase plan. If you need a plan, use `/plan`.

## Gotchas

- "Introspection" invoked mid-task can itself become a procrastination loop — spending effort diagnosing instead of acting. If the report takes longer to write than the next concrete action, skip the report and just change approach.
- Context overflow is often invisible from inside the session — the model cannot reliably detect its own forgetting. External signals (user frustration, repeated explanations of the same fact) are the real diagnostic.
- "Wrong abstraction" is frequently misdiagnosed as "Missing information". If adding data does not unlock the next step but simplifying the code does, the abstraction is the problem.
- Ask-the-user is the escape hatch but it has a cost: user context-switching, latency, fatigue. Use it when you truly cannot proceed, not as a habit to avoid commitment.
- The "fresh start" thought experiment works best when written down. Articulating "if starting over, my first action would be X" out loud often reveals the current approach's sunk-cost fallacy.

## Self-Correction Checklist

These rules are non-negotiable during recovery:

1. **Never retry the exact same action.** If it failed once, it will fail again. Change something.
2. **Never continue a loop "hoping it will work this time."** Hope is not a strategy.
3. **Prefer reading code over guessing behavior.** Open the file. Read the function. Check the types.
4. **When in doubt, ask the user** rather than making assumptions. One specific question beats three wrong guesses.
5. **A 2-line fix is better than a 50-line refactor.** Solve the immediate problem first.
6. **Check if the goal is still correct** before optimizing the approach. Sometimes the task itself needs clarification.
7. **If stuck for more than 3 attempts, escalate.** Tell the user what you tried, what failed, and what you need.

## When NOT to Use

- For debugging user code (not agent self-debugging) — use `/debug`
- For analyzing past sessions to find patterns — use `/mem-search` or `/instinct-review`
- For writing a recovery **plan** that spans multiple steps — use `/plan`
- When the user has already described the failure — respond directly, skip the structured introspection
- As a procrastination mechanism — if the next action is obvious, take it instead of writing a report


## Quick Self-Check (Use Before Retrying Anything)

Before taking the next action after introspection, answer:

- [ ] Is this action **different** from what I already tried?
- [ ] Am I working on the **original goal**, not a tangent?
- [ ] Do I have **enough information** to succeed, or am I guessing?
- [ ] Is this the **simplest** approach that could work?

If any answer is "no", stop and address that first.
